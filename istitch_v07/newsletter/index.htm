<p>In today&rsquo;s consumer culture, the quality of merchandise is compromised to keep up with the needs of a demanding population. Foods and raw materials are produced with harmful chemicals and pesticides. Products are manufactured by people who are not compensated fairly for the work that they do. Resources are depleted to deliver goods cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>Today, however, a new type of retail business is emerging that brings these issues to the forefront of the buyer&rsquo;s decision making process by providing consumers with products that are made with sustainable materials, by workers who are paid fairly. The White Pebble is a retail clothing company that specializes in ethical and sustainable products. All aspects of production are factored in when selecting merchandise from its vendors and product development teams. &ldquo;The problem is that most people out there who want to buy ethically made clothing products simply don&rsquo;t have easy access to them,&rdquo; says Jeremy Whisnant, co-founder and creator of The White Pebble. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our mission provide consumers with that choice.&rdquo;

<p>The original concept for the brand is based upon an Eastern belief that each person symbolically collects and carries with them black or white pebbles based on the choices they make throughout life. Each individual&rsquo;s collection of pebbles symbolizes the quality of choices they make, creating the legacy they leave behind. Black pebbles indicate self-focused, irresponsible decisions, while white pebbles represent a life of sound, ethical choices. The company believes that there are many people who want to buy products that make less of an impact on the environment and are fair to the people who produce them. </p>

<p>The White Pebble recently partnered with istitch to create a brand and e-commerce website. The logo and graphic design are used to articulate the powerful story, which helps to educate potential customers about the significance of the brand. The company&rsquo;s virtual storefront is a fully functioning e-commerce website, highlighting products made from a variety of high-quality, sustainable materials such as bamboo, hemp, soy and organic cotton.</p>

<p>Whether it's your company's annual office party or just some fun with family and friends, it can never hurt to try something new and make a splash at your next shindig. Here's a new kicker that will be sure to raise some eyebrows!</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Chip Wontons</strong><br />
1 package wonton wrappers<br />
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips (approx.)<br />
1 cup brown sugar (approx.)<br />
3 cups canola oil</p>

<p>Lay the wontons on a flat, lightly floured surface and put one teaspoon of brown sugar in the middle with a few (3-4) chocolate chips on top. (It's important not to use too much because if the sugar spills out of the wonton while cooking, it will burn in the pot of oil.)  When the batch has the filling portioned and placed, dab your fingertip with water and coat the top left corner of the wonton. Take the opposite (dry) corner and fold it over, joining the wet corner and the dry corner to form a pocket with the filling inside. Next, take both (folded) corners and fold them so that they touch, dabbing them with water so they stick. Repeat this process in batches.</p>

<p>Heat 2 cups of canola oil in a small pot. Test the temperature of the hot oil by putting a small piece of wonton in the oil. If it cooks and becomes golden brown in about 10-20 seconds, the oil is hot enough. Then put two wontons in at a time, and submerge for about 10-20 seconds or until they are golden brown. Take the wontons out and place them on paper bags to soak up the excess oil. Before the wontons cool down, sprinkle with sugar. Let dry and enjoy!</p>

<p>Last February, istitch Co-Principal Nick Cottrell went to Louisiana to assist with the disaster relief efforts for Hurricane Rita along the Gulf Coast. There, he stayed at a volunteer camp for a week  and worked on various construction projects to help individual families rebuild their homes after the devastating floods that occurred a year and a half prior.</p>

<p>When Nick returned, he came into contact with author David Barringer, who asked if he would be interested in documenting his experience with the Gulf Coast restoration effort. He agreed and is being featured in Barringer's upcoming literary anthology entitled, "The Bush Years Anthology" (working title), which will be released early next year by So-New Publishing. Please stay tuned for more.</p>
